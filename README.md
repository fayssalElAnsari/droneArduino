# presentation
In this project I used the previousely introduced physical notion to make a mathematical/physical design of a drone. The chosen processing unit of the drone is a simple Arduino board.
The main functionalities given to the drone are:
* self balancing.
* remote control.
* different energy consumption modes depending on the batteries charge.

## side notes
In this project I have used different libraries and already given code in order to gain some time and avoid reinventing the wheel.
